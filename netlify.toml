# Netlify Configuration
# This file configures Netlify build and deployment settings

[build]
  # Nuxt build command is handled automatically by Netlify's Nuxt plugin
  # Command defaults to: npm run build

[functions]
  # Note: No SDK dependencies needed - using Snowflake SQL API (REST) instead

[functions.employee-sql-api]
  # Increase timeout for Snowflake SQL API calls (max 26s for free tier, 10s default)
  timeout = 26

# Secret Scanning Configuration
# Note: SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED must be set as an environment variable in
# Netlify's project settings (not in this file).
#
# To disable secret scanning entirely, add this environment variable in Netlify:
#
# SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED=false
#
# See README.md for detailed instructions.
