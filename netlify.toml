# Netlify Configuration
# This file configures Netlify build and deployment settings

[build]
  # Nuxt build command is handled automatically by Netlify's Nuxt plugin
  # Command defaults to: npm run build

# Secret Scanning Configuration
# Note: SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS and SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS must be set as
# environment variables in Netlify's project settings (not in this file).
#
# To exclude server-side function code from secret scanning, add these
# environment variables in Netlify:
#
# SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS=.netlify/functions-internal/server/**,dist/_nuxt/**
#
# Or exclude specific environment variable names:
#
# SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS=SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT,SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME,SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD,SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE,SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE,SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA
#
# See README.md for detailed instructions.
